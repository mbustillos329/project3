## General Info
This project aims to build an App in which users would be able to select a picture and the App will tell them either is a Dog or a Cat.

To create this App first we develop a pre-defined machine learning model in Jupyter notebook, developed a flask App to make it interactive, and finally, we connected this flask App with our HTML file to make it available on the web.

## Tecnologies
* Jupyter Notebook
* HTML
* Flask App
* D3
* Pre-defined Machine Learning Model

## Architecture
In this section, you can find a diagram that represents step by step the process we follow to build our web application:

## Setup
To access the web App you can click on the following link on a web browser:

## Web App funtionalities
The web app has three main sections

* On the left side, you can find the list of pictures available to analyze.

* On top of the web page, you can find a toolbar to go to all the pictures and a summary of the results.

* And finally, in the center of the page, you could see the selected picture and the result of the prediction model.
