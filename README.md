## General Info
This project aims to build an App in which users would be able to select a picture and the App will tell them either is a Dog or a Cat.

To create this App first we develop a pre-defined machine learning model in Jupyter notebook, developed a flask App to make it interactive, and finally, we connected this flask App with our HTML file to make it available on the web.

## Tecnologies
